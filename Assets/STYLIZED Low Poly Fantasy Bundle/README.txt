Hi there!

I’m thrilled that you bought this bundle. Your purchase is a huge support for me and my store. Thank you!

In this text, I’ll share some important things you need to know about this bundle:

- Each set has its own folder, so you can easily find the prefabs and models you want.

- You’ll see that some materials appear more than once, especially the ones that glow. That’s because I used different levels of glow for different objects in each set, and I kept them that way to preserve the original look of the set. For example: a blue glowing sword is brighter than a cauldron with blue glowing liquid, so you’ll see different blue glowing materials for different objects.

- You’ll also find a folder called “Materials” in the main bundle folder. This has the most important materials of the project that most of the assets use and share.

- The basic materials, like MAIN MATERIAL, GLOW and TRANSPARENT, can be easily switched to URP and HDRP. 

I’d love to hear your feedback, fixes and requests at my email (danielmistage18@gmail.com). They would be very helpful for this set and for improving everyone’s experience. I’ll be happy to help you as soon as possible.

I hope you have a blast with this bundle. I had a lot of fun making these packages.

Cheers!

Daniel Mistage.
